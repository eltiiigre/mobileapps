    <string name="Bio">Hi! My name is Ella.
        \n\nI love cats.
        \n\nI have a cat back home.
        \nHis name is Pig~~
        \nPig is a "Pusang Pinoy" with a shade of white and orange stripes.
        \nHe has been with me since I was in Senior High.
        \n\nI have not been home for the longest time due to the pandemic.
        \nAnd that meant not seeing my cat :(
        \nI hope things will get back to normal soon.
        \nBecause being far from the ones you love sucks.
        \n
